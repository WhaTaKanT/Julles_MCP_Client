+# Advanced Feature Requirements
+
+This document details the requirements for advanced client features like Aliases, Triggers, and the External API.
+
+## UR.ADV: Automation and Integration
+The user needs tools to automate repetitive tasks (Aliases, Triggers) and integrate the client with other applications (API).
+
+### Aliases
+
+**FR.ADV.ALIAS.01: Alias Definition**
+The user shall be able to define simple text-replacement aliases (e.g., `n` -> `north`).
+
+**FR.ADV.ALIAS.02: Parameterized Aliases**
+The alias system shall support numbered parameters (e.g., `%1`, `%2`) for creating command templates.
+
+**FR.ADV.ALIAS.03: Alias Management UI**
+The right sidebar shall have an `Aliases` tab for adding, editing, and deleting aliases.
+
+### Triggers
+
+**FR.ADV.TRIG.01: Trigger Definition**
+The user shall be able to define triggers that fire based on incoming text matching a regular expression.
+
+**FR.ADV.TRIG.02: Trigger Actions**
+Supported trigger actions must include at a minimum: `Send Command`, `Highlight Line`, and `Play Sound`.
+
+**FR.ADV.TRIG.03: Capture Group Support**
+The `Send Command` action must support substituting capture groups from the trigger's regex pattern (e.g., `%1`).
+
+**FR.ADV.TRIG.04: Trigger Management UI**
+The right sidebar shall have a `Triggers` tab for adding, editing, and deleting triggers.
+
+### External API
+
+**FR.ADV.API.01: Local HTTP Endpoint**
+The client shall be able to host a local HTTP REST-like API for external control.
+
+**FR.ADV.API.02: Headless Mode**
+The client must be runnable from a command line, without a GUI, to act as a bot or script host.
+
+**FR.ADV.API.03: API Management UI**
+The right sidebar shall have an `External API` tab for starting, stopping, and configuring the API (e.g., port number).
