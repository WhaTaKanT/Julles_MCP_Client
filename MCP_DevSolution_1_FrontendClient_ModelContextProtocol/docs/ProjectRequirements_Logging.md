+# Logging System Requirements
+
+This document details the requirements for the client's logging system.
+
+## UR.LOG: Structured Logging
+The user needs to be able to view and filter incoming server text to separate different types of information, such as chat and combat.
+
+### Functional Requirements
+
+**FR.LOG.UI.01: Log Tab**
+The left sidebar shall be a dedicated `Log` tab.
+
+**FR.LOG.UI.02: Filtered Log Channels**
+The Log tab will contain a `TabControl` to host different, filterable log channels. Default channels shall include: `All`, `Chat`, `Combat`, `System`, and `MCP Debug`.
+
+### Non-Functional Requirements
+**NFR.LOG.PERF.01: High-Performance View**
+The log display must be implemented using UI virtualization to handle a very large number of lines (e.g., millions) without degrading UI performance.
